### Explanation / Thinking

The object is composed of 3 main parts:
- the 'blade'
- the 'handle'
- the 'hand protection'

For the handle: a cylinder and some "inflate" (`sculpt mode`) was enought.
For the blade: I started adding boxes/cylinder but it didn't felt right, so I added only one plane, and created/modified the vertices in `edit mode`. I edited the material to be metalic.
For the hand protection: Adding/Modifying vertices in 3D was trickier.
