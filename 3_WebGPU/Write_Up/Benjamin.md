# Write Up

Shaders and lights.

The code has various view modes to inspect alternative renderings of objects. Viewing normals and UV maps was kind of useful, especially when debugging the import of .obj files.

Additionally, multiple lights can be used to create visually interesting scenes. These lights can be configured in the config.json file, with support for up to 16 lights.

## Reflection

- Discovering a new way to render images was exciting. I was familiar with Shadertoy, so it was fascinating to explore the links between the two.
- With more time (or fewer exams, probably), it would have been interesting to try Raytracing or Raymarching.
